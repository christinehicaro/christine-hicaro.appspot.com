            <p>Hey there, my name's Christine Hicaro and I'm currently a first-year software engineering student at Iowa State University. I'm very passionate about computer science and technology and am seeking opportunities to grow in those fields. I'm particularly looking to obtain an internship this summer so if you like what you see on this page, please feel free to contact me!</p>

                Computer Science Summer Institute is a 3-week program for rising freshmen in college who are passionate about technology. I was one of 30 chosen to participate in the first CSSI program held at the Chicago Google office. During the first two weeks, I was taught the basics of web development by Google engineers; I learned how to utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, Python, JSON, APIs, datastore, and Google App Engine. The third week, I teamed up with two other CSSIers to create a web app, Buildmymusic, from scratch.

                TARGET is a 6-week summer engineering program consisting of an internship and afternoon classes. I was 1 of 18 chosen out of 200 applicants to participate in the program. For my internship portion, I helped create a Microsoft SharePoint site for the Benefits Office of Human Resources and also learned elementary physics in relation to the ASTA magnet at the lab from a physicist. Afternoon classes consisted of completing the following engineering-based projects: soldering a radio, building/soldering a power supply, soldering a detector, designing a rocket cap with AutoCAD, creating a 3D object of choice with AutoCAD, building a Newton's cradle, and making/designing a boomerang.
