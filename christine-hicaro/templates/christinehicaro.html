				<center class = "section-title">About</center>
				<p>Heyo! I'm Christine, a first-year software engineering student at Iowa State University. Originally from La Grange, IL, a suburb of Chicago (I'm not from Chicago Chicago), I tried to switch it up by spending the next couple of years in Ames, Iowa. If you should know one thing about me, it is that I love programming and technology. Other than coding, some of my favorite things are Blue Mountain State, Cookie Dough Creations cookie dough, and, of course, my dog. If you like what you see on this website, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always looking for opportunities to become more involved in all things techy. Thanks for visiting my page!</p>

						Computer Science Summer Institute is a 3-week program for rising freshmen in college who are passionate about technology. I was one of 30 chosen to participate in the first CSSI program held at the Chicago Google office. During the first two weeks, I was taught the basics of web development by Google engineers; I learned how to utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, Python, JSON, APIs, datastore, and Google App Engine. The third week, I teamed up with two other CSSIers to create a web app, Buildmymusic, from scratch.

						TARGET is a 6-week summer engineering program consisting of an internship and afternoon classes. I was 1 of 18 chosen out of 200 applicants to participate in the program. For my internship portion, I helped create a Microsoft SharePoint site for the Benefits Office of Human Resources and also learned elementary physics in relation to the ASTA magnet at the lab from a physicist. Afternoon classes consisted of completing the following engineering-based projects: soldering a radio, building/soldering a power supply, soldering a detector, designing a rocket cap with AutoCAD, creating a 3D object of choice with AutoCAD, building a Newton's cradle, and making/designing a boomerang.
